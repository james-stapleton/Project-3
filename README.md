# The-Cocktail-Curator

Welcome to The Cocktail Curator! We've created a page to offer recommendations based on the temperature of the city you're searching, as well as the option to search by ingredient and name to see all the possible choices out there! There is also an option to save those drinks to a list associated to your account for you to refer to later for when the opportunity arises. The ability to see the most viewed drinks, ranking and the ability to upload your own drinks. Once you go and find the drink you're after you're able to also watch a video on how you'd be able to make it just below!.
